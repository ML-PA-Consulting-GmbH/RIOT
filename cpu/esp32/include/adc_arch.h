 * @brief       Architecture specific ADC definitions and functions for ESP32
 *
 * All ESP32x SoCs have two SAR ADC units each. However, these have
 * functionalities as well as specific properties that vary between the
 * ESP32x SoC and therefore require different handling for each ESP32x SoC.
 * This is already taken into account in the high-level API of the ESP-IDF.
 * To avoid having to reimplement these specifics and the different handling,
 * the high-level API of the ESP-IDF is used directly for the ADC peripherals.

 * @brief   Set the attenuation for the ADC line. Default attenuation is 12 dB.

 * with 12 dB being the standard attenuation. Since an ADC input is measured
 * against a reference voltage Vref of 1.1 V, approximately the following
 * measurement ranges are given when using a corresponding attenuation:
 *
 * <center>
 *
 * Attenuation     | Voltage Range     | Symbol
 * ----------------|-------------------|----------------------
 *  0 dB           | 0 ... 1.1V (Vref) | `ADC_ATTEN_DB_0`
 *  2.5 dB         | 0 ... 1.5V        | `ADC_ATTEN_DB_2_5`
 *  6 dB           | 0 ... 2.2V        | `ADC_ATTEN_DB_6`
 * 12 dB (default) | 0 ... 3.3V        | `ADC_ATTEN_DB_12`
 *
 * </center>
 *
 * @pre   #adc_init must have been executed for the line before.
 * @note  The function has to be executed before @ref adc_sample if required.
 *        The configured attenuation is then used for all subsequent samples.

 * @param [in] atten  Attenuation, see type definition of @ref adc_attenuation_t

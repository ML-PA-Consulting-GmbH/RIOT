 * @defgroup    net_gcoap_fileserver GCoAP file server
 * @ingroup     net_gcoap
 * @brief       Library for serving files from the VFS to CoAP clients
 *
 * # About
 *
 * This maps files in the local file system onto a resources in CoAP. In that,
 * it is what is called a static web server in the unconstrained web.
 *
 * As usual, GET operations are used to read files<!-- WRITESUPPORT, and PUT writes to files.
 * In the current implementation, PUTs are expressed as random-access, meaning
 * that files are not updated atomically -->.
 *
 * Directories are expressed to URIs with trailing slashes<!-- WRITESUPPORT, and are always
 * created implicitly when files are PUT under them; they can be DELETEd when
 * empty -->.
 *
 * @note The file server uses ETag for cache validation. The ETags are built
 * from the file system stat values. As clients rely on the ETag to differ when
 * the file changes, it is important that file modification times are set. The
 * precise time values do not matter, but if a file is changed in place and
 * neither its length nor its modification time is varied, then clients will
 * not become aware of the change or may even mix up the versions half way
 * through if they have a part of the old version cached.
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * * ``USEMODULE += gcoap_fileserver``
 *
 * * Enter a @ref gcoap_fileserver_handler handler into your CoAP server's
 *   resource list like this:
 *
 *   ```
 *   static const coap_resource_t _resources[] = {
 *       ...
 *       {
 *          .path = "/files/sd",
 *          .methods = COAP_GET | COAP_MATCH_SUBTREE,
 *          .handler = gcoap_fileserver_handler,
 *          .context = "/sd0"
 *       },
 *       ...
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 *   The path argument specifies under which path the folder is served via CoAP while
 *   the context argument contains the path on the local filesystem that will be served.
 *
 *   The allowed methods dictate whether it's read-only (``COAP_GET``) or (in the
 *   future<!-- WRITESUPPORT -->) read-write (``COAP_GET | COAP_PUT | COAP_DELETE``).
